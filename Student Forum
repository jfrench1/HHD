	Hip Hop Detoxx is a pragmatically creative organization, which provides an experience that offers a seamless synthesis of truth that challenges conventional perceptions and attitudes. 

	Hip Hop Detoxx as a program assists schools, agencies, and social organizations in their efforts to improve health, reduce violence and negative behavior that currently impede progress and ultimately impact our society and our future with overwhelming economic and social challenges. 
	<p></p>
	With an understanding of The World Health Organization's definition of health - as the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity - our organization considers the physical, social and emotional development of urban youth and the need for interplay between the family, school, community, socio-economic status and physical environment. We believe that if these factors are not working in a collaborative and beneficial manner, development of urban youth is compromised. 
	<p></p>
	Why Hip Hop Detoxx? We use Hip Hop to alleviate the spirit and enable humility for the purpose of addressing problems, conflicts, and issues in the urban environment as they relate to the family, school, community, socio-economic status and physical environment of urban youth.
